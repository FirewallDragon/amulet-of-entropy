# Amulet of Entropy Research

I used the [Amulet of Entropy](https://amuletofentropy.com/) for evaluating entropy noise on simple sensors. This is the basis for a talk I'm giving at the Crypto & Privacy Village at DEF CON 30 titled "Capturing Chaos: Harvesting Environmental Entropy". See the official schedule [here](https://cryptovillage.org/), but as of this writing, I'm scheduled for **Sat, Aug 13 @ 3:30pm**.

If you want to play around with this yourself, start with the [Data Collection](DataCollection.md) document. Otherwise, you can just ignore everything in this directory.
