## Helpful Links

* [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php) - great for batch processing of images files (which I had to do a TON of for this project)
* [cpp.sh](http://cpp.sh/) - an in-browser C++ shell. Handy for quickly trying something out.

## Image Sources

I took or created all the images, except for the ones listed below. (Yeah, I actually bought a Magic 8 Ball and took all 20 pics.) Some of the background images were purchased from Shutterstock.
